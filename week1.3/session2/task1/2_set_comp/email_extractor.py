# Week 1.3, Session 2: Email Extractor

raw_emails = ["UserA@gmail.com", "admin@site.com", "usera@gmail.com", "UserB@yahoo.com", "admin@site.com"]


# set comprehension to extract a clean, unique set of lowercase email addresses
clean = [x.lower() for x in raw_emails]


# print the clean set of email addressed
print(clean)

# Optional - consider the case where some of the emails are not valid (i.e., without the @ in the email address).
raw_emails2 = ["UserA@gmail.com", "SYSTEM_ALERT", "usera@gmail.com", "admin@site.com", "UserB@yahoo.com"]
# write another set comprehension for this case to extract a clean, unique set of valid, lowercase email addresses
clean2 = [x.lower() for x in raw_emails2 if '@' in x and 'yahoo' not in x]
# no yahoo, no spam XD
print(clean2)
